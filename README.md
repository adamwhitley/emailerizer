# Emailerizer

Sick of having to click "Show Images" in HTML emails? Turn your image into a table with 1px cells and it'll show every time!

Useless? I prefer "ahead of it's time".

## What?

This is just a bit of code that uses jQuery/JS and HTML5 Canvas to step through an image and convert each pixel to a 1px table cell with a corresponding bg color. It also colspans like cells and accounts for transparencies to make the resulting table small enough to fit in an email. Still, though... keep the images small.

## Why?

The idea came from a client who was frustrated that his marketing email recipients had to click "Show Image" to see the full email template and a frustrated coder who was sick of using 20-year-old HTML with tables and in-line CSS.

## This Is Pointless

Yes. Yes it is.
